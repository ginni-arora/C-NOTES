OPERATORS IN C++(arithmetic operators)

operators are symbols that tell the compiler to perform specific operations.

1 is ARITHMETIC OPERATORS 

TWO TYPES OF ARITHMETIC OPERATORS 
1. BINARY OPERATOR 
2. UNARY OPERATOR 

BINARY OPERATOR 
+,-,*,/,%

UNARY OPERATOR 
++,--

++ OPERATOR 
THIS IS CALLED INCREMENT OPERATOR 
----->INCREMENT OPERATOR ALSO HAS TWO TYPES 
--> PRE INCREMENTOR (++i)
--> POST INCREMENTOR (i++)

example 
int a =10;
int b;
(pre-increment example)
b=++a;
(in pre-increment )
(increment a instantly)
cout<<a<<" "<<b<<endl;
output a=11
b=11; 

example 
int a =10;
int b;
(post-increment example)
b=a++;
(in post-increment )
(The current value of a is preserved temporarily and will get incremented before the next statement is executed )
cout<<a<<" "<<b<<endl;
output a=11
b=10;

### Code Overview


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int i = 1;
    i = i++ + ++i;
    cout << i << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Include Header File**:
    
    #include<iostream>
    ```
    - This line includes the standard input-output stream library which is necessary for using `cout`.

2. **Namespace Declaration**:
    
    using namespace std;
    ```
    - This allows us to use standard library names without the `std::` prefix.

3. **Main Function**:
    
    int main() {
    ```
    - The `main` function is the entry point of the program.

4. **Variable Declaration and Initialization**:
    
    int i = 1;
    ```
    - This declares an integer variable `i` and initializes it to 1.

5. **Complex Expression**:
    
    i = i++ + ++i;
    ```
    - This is the most interesting part of the code. It involves both post-increment (`i++`) and pre-increment (`++i`) operators. Let's dissect it:
    
    - **Post-increment (`i++`)**:
        - `i++` returns the current value of `i` (which is 1) and then increments `i` by 1. After this operation, `i` becomes 2.
        
    - **Pre-increment (`++i`)**:
        - `++i` increments the current value of `i` (which is now 2) by 1, making it 3, and then returns this new value (3).
        
    - So, the expression can be broken down into:
        - `i++` evaluates to 1 (then `i` becomes 2).
        - `++i` evaluates to 3 (then `i` is 3).
        
    - Now, the expression looks like:
        
        i = 1 + 3;
        
    - Therefore, `i` is assigned the value 4.

6. **Output the Result**:
    ```cpp
    cout << i << endl;
    ```
    - This prints the value of `i` to the console, which is 4.

7. **Return Statement**:
    
    return 0;
    
    - This returns 0, indicating that the program ended successfully.

### Detailed Breakdown of `i = i++ + ++i`

1. The initial value of `i` is 1.
2. Evaluate `i++`:
    - Post-increment: `i++` returns 1 (original value), then `i` becomes 2.
3. Evaluate `++i`:
    - Pre-increment: `++i` increments `i` (2) to 3 and returns 3.
4. Add the results of the two operations:
    - `1 + 3 = 4`
5. Assign the result to `i`:
    - `i = 4`

### Conclusion

The code snippet uses a combination of post-increment and pre-increment operators to manipulate the value of `i`. The key point is understanding the order of operations and how these operators affect the value of `i`. The final value of `i` printed to the console is 4.

2. example 
Let's break down this code step by step to understand how it works and the values of the variables at each stage.

### Code Overview

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int i = 1;
    int j = 2;
    int k;
    k = i + j + i++ + j++ + ++i + ++j;
    cout << i << " " << j << " " << k << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Include Header File**:
    
    #include<iostream>
    
    - This line includes the standard input-output stream library which is necessary for using `cout`.

2. **Namespace Declaration**:
    
    using namespace std;
    ```
    - This allows us to use standard library names without the `std::` prefix.

3. **Main Function**:
    
    int main() {
    ```
    - The `main` function is the entry point of the program.

4. **Variable Declaration and Initialization**:
    
    int i = 1;
    int j = 2;
    int k;
    ```
    - Three integer variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are declared. `i` is initialized to 1, `j` is initialized to 2, and `k` is declared but not initialized.

5. **Complex Expression**:
    
    k = i + j + i++ + j++ + ++i + ++j;
    ```
    - This line calculates the value of `k` using both post-increment (`i++`, `j++`) and pre-increment (`++i`, `++j`) operators. Let's dissect it step by step:

    - **Initial Values**:
        - `i = 1`
        - `j = 2`

    - **Breakdown of the Expression**:
        - `i` (current value of `i`): 1
        - `j` (current value of `j`): 2
        - `i++` (post-increment: return current value and then increment): 1 (then `i` becomes 2)
        - `j++` (post-increment: return current value and then increment): 2 (then `j` becomes 3)
        - `++i` (pre-increment: increment and then return new value): 3 (since `i` was 2, now it becomes 3)
        - `++j` (pre-increment: increment and then return new value): 4 (since `j` was 3, now it becomes 4)

    - Summing these values:
        
        k = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4;
        ```
        - So, `k = 13`.

    - **Final Values of Variables**:
        - `i` becomes 3 after the post-increment and pre-increment operations.
        - `j` becomes 4 after the post-increment and pre-increment operations.

6. **Output the Result**:
    
    cout << i << " " << j << " " << k << endl;
    ```
    - This prints the final values of `i`, `j`, and `k` to the console: `3 4 13`.

7. **Return Statement**:
    
    return 0;
    ```
    - This returns 0, indicating that the program ended successfully.

### Detailed Breakdown of `k = i + j + i++ + j++ + ++i + ++j`

1. Initial values:
    - `i = 1`
    - `j = 2`

2. Evaluate components of the expression:
    - `i` (current value of `i`): 1
    - `j` (current value of `j`): 2
    - `i++` (post-increment): returns 1, then `i` becomes 2
    - `j++` (post-increment): returns 2, then `j` becomes 3
    - `++i` (pre-increment): increments `i` to 3, then returns 3
    - `++j` (pre-increment): increments `j` to 4, then returns 4

3. Calculate the sum:
    - `1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 13`

4. Assign the result to `k`:
    - `k = 13`

5. Final values:
    - `i = 3`
    - `j = 4`
    - `k = 13`

### Conclusion

The code uses a mix of post-increment and pre-increment operators to modify and evaluate the values of `i` and `j` within a single complex expression. The final values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are printed to the console as `3 4 13`.

Certainly! Let's break down this code step by step to understand the values of the variables at each stage, especially focusing on the increments and decrements.

### Code

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int i = 0;
    i = i++ - --i + ++i - i--;
    cout << i << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

    int main() {
    ```
    - The `main` function is the entry point of the program.

4. **Variable Declaration and Initialization**:
    ```cpp
    int i = 0;
    ```
    - This declares an integer variable `i` and initializes it to 0.

5. **Complex Expression**:
    ```cpp
    i = i++ - --i + ++i - i--;
    ```
    - This line calculates the value of `i` using both post-increment (`i++`, `i--`) and pre-increment/decrement (`++i`, `--i`) operators. Let's dissect it step by step:

    - **Initial Value**:
        - `i = 0`

    - **Breakdown of the Expression**:
        - `i++` (post-increment: return current value and then increment): returns 0, then `i` becomes 1
        - `--i` (pre-decrement: decrement and then return new value): decrements `i` to 0, then returns 0
        - `++i` (pre-increment: increment and then return new value): increments `i` to 1, then returns 1
        - `i--` (post-decrement: return current value and then decrement): returns 1, then `i` becomes 0

    - Substituting these values back into the expression:
        ```cpp
        i = 0 - 0 + 1 - 1;
        ```

    - Perform the arithmetic operations:
        ```cpp
        i = 0 - 0 + 1 - 1;
        i = 0;
        ```

    - So, `i` remains 0.

6. **Output the Result**:
    ```cpp
    cout << i << endl;
    ```
    - This prints the final value of `i` to the console: `0`.

7. **Return Statement**:
    ```cpp
    return 0;
    ```
    - This returns 0, indicating that the program ended successfully.

### Detailed Breakdown of `i = i++ - --i + ++i - i--`

1. Initial value:
    - `i = 0`

2. Evaluate components of the expression:
    - `i++` (post-increment): returns 0, then `i` becomes 1
    - `--i` (pre-decrement): decrements `i` to 0, then returns 0
    - `++i` (pre-increment): increments `i` to 1, then returns 1
    - `i--` (post-decrement): returns 1, then `i` becomes 0

3. Substitute these values into the expression:
    - `i = 0 - 0 + 1 - 1`

4. Calculate the result:
    - `i = 0 - 0 + 1 - 1 = 0`

5. Final value:
    - `i = 0`

### Conclusion

The code demonstrates the use of both post-increment and pre-increment/decrement operators within a single expression. Despite the various increments and decrements, the final value of `i` remains 0 due to the arithmetic operations performed. This example highlights the importance of understanding the order of evaluation and side effects of these operators in complex expressions.

    ```
    - This line calculates the value of `m` using post-decrement operators (`i--`, `j--`, `k--`). Let's dissect it step by step:

    - **Initial Values**:
        - `i = 1`
        - `j = 2`
        - `k = 3`

    - **Breakdown of the Expression**:

    - Substituting these values back into the expression:
        ```cpp
        m = 1 - 2 - 3;
        ```

    - Perform the arithmetic operations:
        ```cpp
        m = 1 - 2 - 3;
        m = -1 - 3;
        m = -4;
        ```

    - So, `m = -4`.

    - `j` is now 1 (after the post-decrement operation).
    - `k` is now 2 (after the post-decrement operation).
    - `m` is -4 (result of the expression).

    - `j = 2`
    - `k = 3`

    - `k--` (post-decrement): returns 3, then `k` becomes 2

5. Final values:
    - `i = 0`
    - `j = 1`
    - `k = 2`
    - `m = -4`

### Conclusion

The code demonstrates the use of post-decrement operators within a complex expression. Each variable (`i`, `j`, and `k`) is decremented after its current value is used in the expression to calculate `m`. The final values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `m` are printed to the console as `0 1 2 -4`. This example highlights the importance of understanding the order of evaluation and side effects of post-decrement operators in complex expressions.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
THIRD EXAMPLE

Let's reevaluate the detailed steps of how the expression `k = i-- - i++ + --j - ++j + --i - j-- + ++i - j++` works to ensure we understand why `k` results in `-20`.

### Code

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int i = 10, j = 20, k;
    k = i-- - i++ + --j - ++j + --i - j-- + ++i - j++;
    cout << i << endl;
    cout << j << endl;
    cout << k << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Initial Values**:
    - `i = 10`
    - `j = 20`

2. **Step-by-Step Evaluation of `k`**:
    - `i--`: Returns 10, then `i` becomes 9
    - `i++`: Returns 9, then `i` becomes 10
    - `--j`: Decrements `j` to 19, then returns 19
    - `++j`: Increments `j` to 20, then returns 20
    - `--i`: Decrements `i` to 9, then returns 9
    - `j--`: Returns 20, then `j` becomes 19
    - `++i`: Increments `i` to 10, then returns 10
    - `j++`: Returns 19, then `j` becomes 20

3. **Substitute These Values Back into the Expression**:
    ```cpp
    k = 10 - 9 + 19 - 20 + 9 - 20 + 10 - 19;
    ```

4. **Perform the Arithmetic Operations**:
    - Step-by-step:
      ```cpp
      k = 10 - 9; // 1
      k = 1 + 19; // 20
      k = 20 - 20; // 0
      k = 0 + 9; // 9
      k = 9 - 20; // -11
      k = -11 + 10; // -1
      k = -1 - 19; // -20
      ```

5. **Final Values**:
    - `i = 10` (incremented and decremented back to original value)
    - `j = 20` (incremented and decremented back to original value)
    - `k = -20`

### Explanation

1. **First Operation: `i--`**:
    - `i` is 10 before the decrement.
    - `i--` evaluates to 10.
    - `i` becomes 9 after the decrement.

2. **Second Operation: `i++`**:
    - `i` is 9 before the increment.
    - `i++` evaluates to 9.
    - `i` becomes 10 after the increment.

3. **Third Operation: `--j`**:
    - `j` is 20 before the decrement.
    - `--j` decrements `j` to 19 and evaluates to 19.

4. **Fourth Operation: `++j`**:
    - `j` is 19 before the increment.
    - `++j` increments `j` to 20 and evaluates to 20.

5. **Fifth Operation: `--i`**:
    - `i` is 10 before the decrement.
    - `--i` decrements `i` to 9 and evaluates to 9.

6. **Sixth Operation: `j--`**:
    - `j` is 20 before the decrement.
    - `j--` evaluates to 20.
    - `j` becomes 19 after the decrement.

7. **Seventh Operation: `++i`**:
    - `i` is 9 before the increment.
    - `++i` increments `i` to 10 and evaluates to 10.

8. **Eighth Operation: `j++`**:
    - `j` is 19 before the increment.
    - `j++` evaluates to 19.
    - `j` becomes 20 after the increment.

9. **Final Evaluation of `k`**:
    - Substitute the values:
      ```cpp
      k = 10 - 9 + 19 - 20 + 9 - 20 + 10 - 19;
      ```
    - Perform arithmetic operations step-by-step:
      ```cpp
      k = 10 - 9; // 1
      k = 1 + 19; // 20
      k = 20 - 20; // 0
      k = 0 + 9; // 9
      k = 9 - 20; // -11
      k = -11 + 10; // -1
      k = -1 - 19; // -20
      ```

### Conclusion

The code uses a series of post-increment, pre-increment, post-decrement, and pre-decrement operations that affect the values of `i` and `j` during the calculation of `k`. The final value of `k` is `-20`. The printed values are:
- `i = 10`
- `j = 20`
- `k = -20`
